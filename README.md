I have added the user authentication to this project using Okta.
Okta is a cloud service that allows developers to create, edit, and securely store user accounts and user account data, and connect them with one or multiple applications. If you donâ€™t already have one, sign up for a forever-free developer account. Log in to your developer console, navigate to Applications, then click Add Application. Select Single-Page App, then click Next.
Since Create React App runs on port 3000 by default, you should add that as a Base URI and Login Redirect URI.

Before start this project, you have to add some Okta's infomations into .env file.
- your Client ID 
- your organization URL (without the -admin suffix)
- API token

#Get Started
- yarn install
- yarnt start

Run http://localhost:3000/ and http://localhost:4001/graphql
